# DeepShield-WebApp
DeepShield is an AI-powered web platform designed to detect, simulate, and analyze misinformation and synthetic media threats across text, image, audio, and video content. It empowers organizations and individuals to understand and counter the growing risks of deepfakes, social engineering, and influence manipulation.
Description:
DeepShield is an AI-driven simulation and detection platform designed to safeguard organizations and individuals against misinformation, deepfakes, and social engineering attacks. The system integrates multimodal AI detection, influence-network simulation, and legal awareness tools into a unified web interface. Using deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, GAN discriminators, and transformer-based NLP models, DeepShield analyzes text, images, audio, and video to detect manipulation and misinformation in real time.

The platform features a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard that visualizes detection results, influence propagation, and organizational resilience metrics. Additionally, it includes automated reporting and legal guidance modules to support ethical and transparent response mechanisms. Designed for scalability and accessibility, DeepShield provides a proactive defense framework against digital misinformation and deepfake threats, enhancing both technological and societal resilience.
